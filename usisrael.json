    {
      "What happened": "On February 28, 2026, the US and Israel launched 'Operation Epic Fury,' executing massive coordinated airstrikes on Tehran and other Iranian provinces, heavily targeting nuclear sites, missile facilities, and leadership compounds.",
      "Why it matters": "This unprecedented direct military intervention marks a severe escalation in the Middle East. The US explicitly called for regime change, directly challenging the survival of Iran's government and risking a full-scale, multi-front regional war.",
      "The big picture": "Iran immediately retaliated by firing ballistic missiles at Israel and US military bases across the Gulf, including installations in Bahrain and the UAE. Regional airspaces have been closed, and neighboring nations are bracing for widespread destabilization."
