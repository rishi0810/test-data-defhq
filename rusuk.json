      "What happened": "In late February 2026, Russian forces unleashed a concentrated artillery, missile, and drone bombardment on key eastern Ukrainian cities, including Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka.",
      "Why it matters": "This aggressive battlefield air interdiction campaign signals the preparatory phase for a massive Spring-Summer 2026 ground offensive aimed at breaking the heavily fortified defensive backbone of Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast.",
      "The big picture": "As the war enters its fifth year, combined casualties are approaching 2 million. With recent US-mediated peace talks in Geneva stalling over security guarantees, both nations are locking into a protracted, high-intensity phase of attrition."
